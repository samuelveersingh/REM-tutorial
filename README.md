The Reinforced EM algorithm is applied to cluster the Glass Identification dataset from UCI: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/glass?datasetId=738&sortBy=voteCount. The glass dataset comprises 9 features, where the first feature represents the refractive index, followed by weight percentages of the chemical elements Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Ba, and Fe. Different compositions of these elements in glass result in different types of glass. The ground truth labels of the dataset consist of 7 labels.
